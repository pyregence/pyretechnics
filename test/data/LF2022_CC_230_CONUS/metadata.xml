      <abstract>LANDFIRE's (LF) 2022 Forest Canopy Cover (CC) describes the percent cover of the tree canopy in a stand. CC is a vertical projection of the tree canopy cover onto an imaginary horizontal plane. CC supplies information for fire behavior models to determine the probability of crown fire initiation, provide input in the spotting model, calculate wind reductions, and to calculate fuel moisture conditioning. To create this product, plot level CC values are calculated using the canopy fuel estimation software, Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Pre-disturbance CC and Canopy Height (CH) are used as predictors of disturbed CC using a linear regression equation per Fuel Vegetation Type (FVT), disturbance type/severity, and time since disturbance. CC is used in the calculation of Canopy Bulk Density (CBD) and Canopy Base Height (CBH). In LF 2022, fuel products are created with LF 2016 Remap vegetation in areas that were un-disturbed in the last ten years. 

To designate disturbed areas where CC is modified, the aggregated Annual Disturbance products from 2013 to 2022 in the Fuel Disturbance (FDist) product are used. All existing disturbances between 2013-2022 are represented in the LF 2022 update, and the products are intended to be used in 2023 (the year of release). The "capable" year terminology used in LF 2020 and LF 2016 Remap is no longer specified, due to reduction in latency from when a disturbance occurs to the release date of fuel products accounting for that disturbance. However, users should still consider adjusting fuel layers for disturbances that occurred after the end of the 2022 fiscal year (after October 1st, 2022) when using the LF 2022 fuel products. Because those changes would not be accounted for. Learn more about LF 2022 at https://landfire.gov/lf_230.php 
</abstract>
      <purpose> The LANDFIRE 2022 Update (LF 2022) is designed to produce vegetation, disturbance, and fuels products that inform wildland fire and ecological decision systems. LF 2022 is another update to the LF 2016 Remap base map and LF 2020, it includes adjustments to vegetation and fuels in disturbed areas for disturbances recorded in 2021 and 2022. Disturbances in 2022 represent the first full fiscal year of disturbance. Transition rulesets for vegetation account for disturbances from 2017 to 2022 while fuel updates utilize 2012 to 2022 disturbances. In LF 2022 Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) Ecological Systems classifications are the same as LF 2020, except in areas where agriculture or urban areas have changed. LF 2022 contains the first application of the "zero to one" Time Since Disturbance (TSD) rules for EVC and EVH transition rules. Both LF Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC) and Height (EVH), as well as all fuels products, are 2023 capable in disturbed areas. 

LF 2022 products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives.  

Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Managers and planners must evaluate LF products according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs. </purpose>
      <supplinf>Units are percent canopy cover. The values of canopy cover are class midpoints. Beginning in the LF 2020 update and continued into the LF 2022 update, all CONUS products are created with a 90km buffer into both Canada and Mexico. The data in this buffer was last updated in LF 2020. LF 2022 AK products also feature a 90km buffer into Canada, but this buffer was last updated with new data in LF 2016 Remap. The following LF 2022 products have 2023 capability functionality: EVH, EVC, CBD, CBH, CC, CH, F13, F40, FVC, FVH, FVT, CFFDRS and FDist.

        <procdesc>Beginning with the new base map of LF 2016 Remap (LF Remap), products were created using recent advances in image compositing, tiling algorithms, and faster computing hardware to ensure that LF products remained relevant. LF Remap leveraged the Landsat archive, lidar data, and user contributed field plot data compiled into the LF Reference Database (LFRDB), to create new vegetation products.  

Reference resources included, but were not limited to, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program plot data (USFS https://fia.fs.fed.us/), Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent [(DSWE) USGS https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions], the National Land Cover Database [(NLCD) USGS https://www.mrlc.gov/data], and National Agricultural Statistics Service [(NASS) USDA - https://www.nass.usda.gov/].  

For LF 2022 reference resources included, but were not limited to, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity [(MTBS) USGS https://mtbs.gov/], Burned Area Reflectance Classification [(BARC) USFS and USGS] and Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire [(RAVG) https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/ravg/], National Agricultural Statistics Service [(NASS) USDA - https://www.nass.usda.gov/] for 2022, PAD 3.0 for federal and protected lands identification [https://doi.org/10.5066/P9Q9LQ4B], and a rasterized version of the Microsoft building footprint for 2022 to update developed areas [https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints]. Disturbances in LF 2022 were also identified with LF's remote sensing of landscape change (RSLC), which identifies spectral change in vegetation using automated algorithms and image analyst review of the entire country with Landsat imagery. Burned Area (BA) data from Landsat was also used and national events (polygons) were used to identify areas and types of disturbance.
